# Networking 

- OSI Model
	- Application; layer 7 (and basically layers 5 & 6) (includes API, HTTP, etc).
	- Transport; layer 4 (TCP/UDP).
	- Network; layer 3 (Routing).
	- Datalink; layer 2 (Error checking and frame synchronisation).
	- Physical; layer 1 (Bits over fibre).	
- Firewalls
	- Rules to prevent incoming and outgoing connections.	
- NAT 
	- Useful to understand IPv4 vs IPv6.
- DNS
	- (53)
	- Requests to DNS are usually UDP, unless the server gives a redirect notice asking for a TCP connection. Look up in cache happens first. DNS exfiltration. Using raw IP addresses means no DNS logs, but there are HTTP logs. DNS sinkholes.
	- In a reverse DNS lookup, PTR might contain- 2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa, which will map to  208.80.152.2. DNS lookups start at the end of the string and work backwards, which is why the IP address is backwards in PTR.

	- Sending data as subdomains. 
	- 26856485f6476a567567c6576e678.badguy.com

- Do not blame the user
	- Security is about protecting people, we should build technology that people can trust, not constantly blame users. 


# Cryptography, Authentication, Identity 

- Encryption vs Encoding vs Hashing vs Obfuscation vs Signing
	- Be able to explain the differences between these things. 
	- [Various attack models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_model) (e.g. chosen-plaintext attack).

- Encryption standards + implementations
	- [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) (asymmetrical).
	- [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) (symmetrical).
	- [ECC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA) (namely ed25519) (asymmetric).
	- [Chacha/Salsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variant) (symmetric).

- Asymmetric vs symmetric
	- Asymmetric is slow, but good for establishing a trusted connection.
	- Symmetric has a shared key and is faster. Protocols often use asymmetric to transfer symmetric key.
	- Perfect forward secrecy - eg Signal uses this.

- Cyphers
	- Block vs stream [ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher).
	- [Block cipher modes of operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation).
	- [AES-GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode).

- Integrity and authenticity primitives
	- [Hashing functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) e.g. MD5, Sha-1, BLAKE. Used for identifiers, very useful for fingerprinting malware samples.
	- [Message Authentication Codes (MACs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code).
	- [Keyed-hash MAC (HMAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC).

- Entropy
	- PRNG (pseudo random number generators).
	- Entropy buffer draining.

	- O-auth
		- Bearer tokens, this can be stolen and used, just like cookies.
	- Auth Cookies
		- Client side.
	- Sessions 
		- Server side.
	- Auth systems 
		- SAMLv2o.
		- OpenID.

# Detection

- IDS
	- Intrusion Detection System (signature based (eg. snort) or behaviour based).
	- Snort/Suricata/YARA rule writing
	- Host-based Intrusion Detection System (eg. OSSEC)

- SIEM
	- Security Information and Event Management.

- IOC 
	- Indicator of compromise (often shared amongst orgs/groups).
	- Specific details (e.g. IP addresses, hashes, domains)

- Things that create signals
	- Honeypots, snort.

- Things that triage signals
	- SIEM, eg splunk.

- Things that will alert a human 
	- Automatic triage of collated logs, machine learning.
	- Notifications and analyst fatigue.
	- Systems that make it easy to decide if alert is actual hacks or not.

- Signatures
	- Host-based signatures
		- Eg changes to the registry, files created or modified.
		- Strings in found in malware samples appearing in binaries installed on hosts (/Antivirus).
	- Network signatures
		- Eg checking DNS records for attempts to contact C2 (command and control) servers. 

- Anomaly / Behaviour based detection 
	- IDS learns model of “normal” behaviour, then can detect things that deviate too far from normal - eg unusual urls being accessed, user specific- login times / usual work hours, normal files accessed.  
	- Can also look for things that a hacker might specifically do (eg, HISTFILE commands, accessing /proc).
	- If someone is inside the network- If action could be suspicious, increase log verbosity for that user.

- Firewall rules
	- Brute force (trying to log in with a lot of failures).
	- Detecting port scanning (could look for TCP SYN packets with no following SYN ACK/ half connections).
	- Antivirus software notifications.
	- Large amounts of upload traffic.

- Honey pots
	- Canary tokens.
	- Dummy internal service / web server, can check traffic, see what attacker tries.

- Things to know about attackers
	- Slow attacks are harder to detect.
	- Attacker can spoof packets that look like other types of attacks, deliberately create a lot of noise.
	- Attacker can spoof IP address sending packets, but can check TTL of packets and TTL of reverse lookup to find spoofed addresses.
	- Correlating IPs with physical location (is difficult and inaccurate often).

- Logs to look at
	- DNS queries to suspicious domains.
	- HTTP headers could contain wonky information.
	- Metadata of files (eg. author of file) (more forensics?).
	- Traffic volume.
	- Traffic patterns.
	- Execution logs.

- Detection related tools
	- Splunk.
	- Arcsight.
	- Qradar.
	- Darktrace.
	- Tcpdump.
	- Wireshark.
	- Zeek.
